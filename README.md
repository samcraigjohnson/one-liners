# One Liners

This is a collection of helpful scripts I have built over the years to do various things around my computer. They aren't actually one line (some of them are quite long) but they all try to solve one problem, without any configuration.

Please feel free to fork/rename do whatever with these.

I have lots more of these on my computer, and will periodically update them.

Follow me on twitter to get updates about it: [@samcraigjohnson](https://twitter.com/samcraigjohnson).

## Setup

I have a `~/bin` folder that I have added to my `PATH` for all my scripts. If you want to use these, just clone the directory and either add the directory path to your `PATH` or symlink the scripts you want to your `~/bin` folder.

## Niceshot

Looks like this when it's done. Varies based on your background image.

## Comments

This uses a lot of system commands mixed with ruby for ease-of-use.
